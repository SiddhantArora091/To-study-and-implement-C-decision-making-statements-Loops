## Program 1: Print Numbers 1 to 20

**Theory:**  
A `while` loop is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a counter `i = 0`.
2. While `i < 20`, do:
   - Print `i + 1` followed by a space.
   - Increment `i`.
   - Print a newline.

**Output:**
```
1
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
```

**Conclusion:**  
Introduces the use of `while` loops and basic output formatting.

## Program 2: Number Triangle

**Theory:**  
Nested loops allow iteration over multiple dimensions (like rows and columns). Here, they're used to print increasing numbers in a triangle pattern.

**Algorithm:**
1. Input the number of rows.
2. Initialize a counter `num = 1`.
3. Loop over rows (i from 1 to n):
   - For each row, print `i` numbers starting from `num`.
   - Increment `num` accordingly.

**Output:**
```
Enter number of rows: 6

1 
2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 10 
11 12 13 14 15 
16 17 18 19 20 21
```

**Conclusion:**  
Helps understand nested loops and control of variables inside loop bodies.

## Program 3: Diamond Star Pattern

**Theory:**  
Pattern printing requires understanding how to manipulate spacing and symbols using nested loops. Symmetric shapes involve reversing patterns.

**Algorithm:**
1. Set `n = 7` for the total width.
2. Loop to print upper half of diamond:
   - Print increasing spaces and decreasing stars.
3. Loop to print lower half:
   - Reverse the logic of the upper half.

**Output:**
```
* * * * * * * 
  * * * * * 
    * * * 
      * 
    * * * 
  * * * * * 
* * * * * * * 
```

**Conclusion:**  
Demonstrates loop nesting, symmetry, and output formatting.

## Program 4: Left-Aligned Triangle of Stars

**Theory:**  
Basic triangle patterns can be printed by controlling the number of stars in each row based on the row number.

**Algorithm:**
1. Set `n = 5`.
2. Loop `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - Loop `j` from 1 to `i`.
   - Print stars.

**Output:**
```
*

***
****
*****
```

**Conclusion:**  
Teaches how to print increasing patterns using simple nested loops.

## Program 5: Nested Loop with Labels

**Theory:**  
Nested loops can be used to iterate over multiple levels. Each loop can perform independent tasks.

**Algorithm:**
1. Loop `i` from 1 to 2 (outer loop).
   - Print "Outer" with `i`.
   - Loop `j` from 1 to 3 (inner loop).
     - Print "Inner" with `j`.

**Output:**
```
Outer:1
Inner:1
Inner:2
Inner:3
Outer:2
Inner:1
Inner:2
Inner:3
```

**Conclusion:**  
Clarifies how inner loops work within outer loops.

## Program 6: Right-Aligned Triangle of Stars

**Theory:**  
To align triangles to the right, we print spaces before stars. The number of spaces decreases as stars increase.

**Algorithm:**
1. Set `n = 5`.
2. Loop `i` from 1 to `n`:
   - Print `n - i` spaces.
   - Print `i` stars.

**Output:**
```
    *
   **
  ***
 ****
*****
```

**Conclusion:**  
Combines spacing and pattern logic for formatted output.

## Program 7: Print Even Numbers from 0 to 10

**Theory:**  
The modulus operator (`%`) is used to determine divisibility. Even numbers have no remainder when divided by 2.

**Algorithm:**
1. Loop from `i = 0` to `10`.
2. If `i % 2 == 0`, print `i`.

**Output:**
```
0
2
4
6
8
10
```

**Conclusion:**  
Demonstrates use of conditional statements inside loops.

## Program 8: Password Authentication System

**Theory:**  
Programs can control access using conditionals and loops. Limited attempts add basic security.

**Algorithm:**
1. Set correct password as a constant.
2. Allow up to 3 user attempts.
3. If correct, unlock system.
4. Else, decrement attempt and retry or lock system.

**Output:**
```
Enter the password: 464
Incorrect Password. Try again. Attempts left: 2

Enter the password: 6
Incorrect Password. Try again. Attempts left: 1

Enter the password: 8
No attempts left. System locked.
```

**Conclusion:**  
Practices input validation, `while` loops, and conditionals.

## Program 9: Reverse an Integer

**Theory:**  
Numbers can be reversed by extracting digits using modulo and forming a new number by multiplying the result by 10 and adding each digit.

**Algorithm:**
1. Set `reversed = 0`.
2. While number > 0:
   - Get last digit using `% 10`.
   - Update reversed number.
   - Remove digit from original number using `/ 10`.

**Output:**
```
Reversed number: 77032
```

**Conclusion:**  
Teaches number manipulation using loops and arithmetic operations.

## Program 10: Print "SIT" 6 Times

**Theory:**  
Loops are used to execute repeated tasks efficiently.

**Algorithm:**
1. Loop from 0 to 5.
2. Print `"SIT"` each iteration.

**Output:**
```
SIT
SIT
SIT
SIT
SIT
SIT
```

**Conclusion:**  
Simple use of loop for repeated output.
